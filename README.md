UdacityML Course

This repo contains the following projects

Decision Trees:

Exploring the use of Decision Trees to predict the survival rate of passengers on the titanic using data processing techniques one-hot encoding to help tidy our data sets

Naive Bayes:

Using Naive Bayes on SMS messages to help detect Spam messages. This is a supervised learning problem, as we will be feeding a labelled dataset into the model, that it can learn from, to make future predictions.

Neural Networks:

Leveraging CNNs to allow users to pass their own images into the algorithm to predict whether the image contains a dog or not and if it does what breed of dog the photos contain

Reinforcement Learning:

Creating a task, agent and reward system to train a quadcopter to fly

Supervised Learning:

Taking Data from the 1994 US Census and using the information to accurately model individual's incomes using Algorithms such as KNN, Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier, Logistic Regression, SVM.

Unsupervised Learning:

Using PCA for facial recognition

Udacity Capstone Project:

This investigation hopes to use the Kaggle dataset to investigate social and economic aspects of student's lives and see if their final grades can be predicted based on these.
